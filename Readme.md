# Enhancing GPT-OSS with Multimodal Vision Capabilities

Final Year Project

This project extends the open-weight GPT-OSS language model with visual perception
capabilities through projection-based vision–language alignment. The system supports
image captioning, visual question answering, and multimodal instruction following,
with a foundation for adaptation to Earth Observation (EO) data such as ISRO satellite imagery.
